I have something here that is a fast method to change your USB polling rate to 1000hz (1.00ms response time). .

Windows Vista & 7 64-bit

1. What you required: HIDUSBF.zip - dimr.exe (Direct Input Mouse Rate).
2. unzip the zipped file HIDUSBF.zip & dimr.exe into a proper directory.
3. Right click on "HIDUSBF.INF" find install (If Warning popping up about unsigned drivers then don't take stress)
4. Open up dseo13b.exe and find the status "Enable Test Mode"
5. Restart
6. After Restarting , you will get "Test mode Windows XXXX build XXXX" You can get rid of it but for currently open dseo13b.exe again and find "Sign a system file"
7. In the box type in "C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\HIDUSBF.sys". If true a window will popped up saying "The system file has been signed succesfully..."
8. Restart
9. Reopen HIDUSBF directory and click on "Setup.exe"
10. Find your mouse click on it (it should be highlighted contains blue) and at the bottom of the window find "Filter On Device" and choose your Rate
11. Click Restart and open up dimr.exe. If it's still launched default 125hz then restart your windows Vista or 7 64-bit operating system again
12. To remove watermark open dseo13b.exe and click on Remove watermarks. It will provide you the link for jumping on the website with the proper files to remove it


Windows XP/Vista/7 32-bit

1. Right click on "HIDUSBF.INF" find install
(Note sometimes with XP if you apply and the mouse stops responding in this case restart again and try again)

2. Open HIDUSBF folder and click on "Setup.exe"

3. Find your mouse click on it (it should be highlighted has blue) and at the bottom of the window check "Filter On Device" and select your Rate

4. Click Restart and open up dimr.exe. If it's still runs default 125hz reboot
